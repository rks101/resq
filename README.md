My notes on venues to publish, core conference ranking, finding CFP, etc.   

## CS Venues   

[CS Venues](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/csconf.html) - to see top publication venues and average citations per paper.    

[CORE Conference ranking portal](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/) - CORE database for conferences    

[CORE CS conferences](https://iiti.ac.in/people/~artiwari/cseconflist.html)   

[ORCID](https://orcid.org/signin) - aggregate your contributions with a single ORC ID.   

## Journal Indexing   
Journal indexing can impact search/findings of your publications to others.   

[DBLP](https://dblp.org/) open indexing for CS publications   
[SCI]() - Science Citation Index   
[SCIe]() - Science Citation Index Expanded   
[Ei Compendex](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/engineering-village/content/compendex) from Elsevier    
[Scopus](https://scopusindexedjournals.com/)     
Google Scholar    
Web of Science   

[Scimago Journal Ranking](https://www.scimagojr.com/)   

Q1 (green) comprises the quarter of the journals with the highest values,   
Q2 (yellow) is the quarter with the second-highest-value journals,    
Q3 (orange) is the quarter with the third-highest-value journals, and    
Q4 (red) is the quarter with the lowest-value journals (may be avoided after inquiry).    

e.g.    
[ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR)](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23038&tip=sid&clean=0) is continuously green (Q1) during 2000-2022

Advice:    
1. Target/publish in the journals in the top quartile Q1 or Q2: so that your work is reviewed by peers rigourously and reflects better credibility.    
2. Do not go after citation numbers (they can be synthetic) or numerical impact factor only (can be deceptive), to just publish your work.    
3. Inquire about the venue, quality of reviews, free/paid model, before you submit to publish your work. Be brave to get rejections with good reviews from a good venue.    
4. Avoid Open-Access only or paid journals to publish your work.   
5. Regularly/Every year self-review at least 5-6 papers in your area to assess the work been done. Submit reviews without a reminder and within time! or do not accept to review. This helps the research community.    
6. Share papers with your scholars to assess how rigourously they review papers, it could be English/language aspects as well. Discuss and share what not to do and how not to publish, more than how to publish.    
7. Pay attention to references while you read/review papers, you might find pearls of wisdom :) (This is subjective.)    
8. Never submit a work without self-checking plagiarism. Target single digit similarity or less than 12% of similarity (for own contribution) or less than 18% of similarity (for Surveys/SoK). How dirty is to submit verbatim copied/similar paragraph or full-sentences? They could be and should be desk-rejected.      
9. Never submit a work to publish by adding someone's name in the end or referencing few highly-cited or synthetic citations-laid papers. This does not help the research community.     


Note:-   
1. Open Access - is a model in which the authors pay article publishing charges (APC), and publication is open for all online. There are Gold/Silver/Bronze options for a wider reach of the audience having access to such publications. Many publications are turning into Open Access due to reduced memberships. You may avoid Open Access to save APC.    
2. Sponsored / Paid Access -  as the name suggests, its pay and publish model. Early researchers should avoid it.    
3. Special/companion edition - look for indexing and reputation.    

It is wise to stay away from country-specific predatory journals or controversial journals.
