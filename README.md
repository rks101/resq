## Journal Indexing   
Journal indexing can impact the search/findings of your publications to others.   

[DBLP](https://dblp.org/) open indexing for CS publications   
[SCI]() - Science Citation Index   
[SCIe]() - Science Citation Index Expanded   
[Ei Compendex](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/engineering-village/content/compendex) from Elsevier    
[Scopus](https://scopusindexedjournals.com/)     
Google Scholar    
Web of Science   

[Scimago Journal Ranking](https://www.scimagojr.com/)   

Q1 (green) comprises the quarter of the journals with the highest values,   
Q2 (yellow) is the quarter with the second-highest-value journals,    
Q3 (orange) is the quarter with the third-highest-value journals, and    
Q4 (red) is the quarter with the lowest-value journals (may be avoided after inquiry).    

e.g.    
[ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR)](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23038&tip=sid&clean=0) is continuously green (Q1) during 2000-2022     
[Computers and Security (CompSec)](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=28898&tip=sid&clean=0) is continuously green (Q1) during 2011-2022.    
[IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials (COMSUR)](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17900156715&tip=sid&clean=0) is green (Q1) during 2006-2022.    
[IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=27237&tip=sid&clean=0) (ToN) is continuously green (Q1) during 1999-2022.       
[IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=28918&tip=sid&clean=0) (TDSC)

Top CS Journals and Transactions may take up to 2 years from manuscript submission to acceptance notification and publishing. Hope this turnaround time reduces to half.

## Conferences   

Top CS conferences can have a paper acceptance rate well below 18% or less than 1 in 6 papers submitted without desk rejection.     

The reason for a desk rejection can be:     
- length (too short or more prolonged than mentioned in CFP)),    
- formatting of paper not as mentioned in CFP (single or 2-column, figures, tables, references, LNCS/IEEE/ACM style not adhered to),    
- no relevance to the venue or conference,     
- conference no longer accepting papers from a specific area,     
- plagiarism (more than 18-20% similarity detected),    
- too obvious "Engligh/languase" issues, etc. (<- Hope you noticed!!)     


In Computer Science and related areas, conferences are rated higher and preferred because of rigorous peer reviews with quick feedback, usually notifying within 3-4 months.     

e.g.    
- CCS ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 
- ESORICS - European Symposium on Research in Computer Security  
- ICSE - [International Conference on Software Engineering](http://www.icse-conferences.org/)   
- ICIS - International Conference on Information Systems
- IFIP WG 11 - IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference on Data and Applications Security (was IFIP-DBSEC)
- S&P - 	IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy
- USENIX-Sec - Usenix Security
- ARES - International Conference on Availability, Reliability, and Security
- FSE - ACM Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering
- FST & TCS - Foundations of Software Technology & Theoretical Computer Science
- ICSP - International Conference on Software Process
- ISSTA - Internation Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis
- SPICE - Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination
- SSR - ACM Symposium on Software Reusability
- COMPSAC - International Computer Software and Applications Conference
- PASTE - ACM SIGSOFT Workshop on Program Analysis for Software Tools and Engineering
- STEP - Software Technology and Engineering Practice Conference
- MSR - Mining Software Repositories
- PETs - Privacy Enhancing Technologies (with PoPET)

## Advice    

1. Target/publish in the journals or conferences in the top quartile Q1 or Q2 so that your work is reviewed by peers rigorously and reflects better credibility. Keep a catalog of review comments received, like your photos, because someone gave their time, dared to comment, and helped you on your work to improve it further.     
2. Do not go after citation numbers (they can be synthetic) or numerical impact factors only (can be deceptive) to publish your work.    
3. Inquire about the venue, quality of reviews, and free/paid model before you submit to publish your work. Be open to getting rejections with good reviews from a suitable venue.    
4. Avoid Open-Access only or paid journals to publish your work.    
5. Regularly/Every year, self-review at least 4-5 papers in your area to assess the work being done. Submit reviews without a reminder and within time! Or do not accept to review. This helps the research community.    
6. Share papers with your scholars to assess how rigourously they review papers, it could be English/language aspects as well. Discuss and share what not to do and how not to publish with others. These days, it is needed more than how to publish.    
7. Pay attention to references while you read/review papers; you might find pearls of wisdom :)     
8. Never submit a work without self-checking plagiarism. Target single-digit similarity or less than 12% of similarity (for own contribution) or less than 18% (for Surveys/SoK). How disrespectful it is to submit papers with verbatim copied paragraphs or huge similarities in any paragraph or verbatim copied complete sentences! They should be desk rejected without further review. To avoid this, write your own work, in your own words, use recall or understanding of concepts in your words. Please don't look at some text and rephrase/restructue to defeat plagiarism tools.       
9. Never submit a work to publish by adding someone's name in the end or by referencing few highly-cited or synthetic citations-laid papers. This does not help the research community. It should be okay to retire with 10-15-20 papers without such malpractice.       
10. Write papers on your own from scratch. Before communicating, do a self-review to reject your own work on the technical writing, the coverage, and plagiarism. Avoid generative AI tools for writing papers - they should be desk-rejected by publishers.     


Note:-   
1. Open Access - is a model in which the authors pay article publishing charges (APC), and publication is open for all online. There are Gold/Silver/Bronze options for the audience. Many publications are turning to the Open Access model due to reduced memberships. You should avoid Open Access only model to save APC.    
2. Sponsored / Paid Access -  as the name suggests, it is a pay and publish model. Avoid it.    
3. Special/companion edition - look for indexing, availability and reputation.    

It is wise to stay away from country-specific predatory journals, controversial journals, or the ones banned by any agency in the country.

## Publishers and Societies    

Elsevier    
Springer / Springer Nature    
IEEE     
ACM     
SIG - Special Interest Groups with ACM     
Nature    
Wiley    
SAGE    

Note: 
1. ScienceDirect is a platform/tool of Elsevier, a publishing company.    
2. arXiv is not a publisher, it is a great repository to claim or make your work available online without an accepted publication yet. You should check with the publisher if they want you to remove the paper from arXiv because of the embargo period.   
3. Subscription-based versus Open Access (OA) model: One main difference is the publication dissemination cost. Under the subscription-based agreement, the publishing company (Elsevier/ACM/IEEE) absorbs the costs, and the end users/researchers have to pay through institutional contract or by self per paper. Under the Open Access model, the author pays article publishing charges (APC) for the access to publication instead of the end users/researchers.

## Writing Tools   
[LaTex](https://github.com/rks101/latex) - on a Linux system, install the texlive-full package to bring the most of LaTex and beamer packages you may need.   
[Overleaf](overleaf.com) - an online LaTeX editor can help for easy editing online.   
Spell checker - one should definitely use a spell checker before submission.    

xxx Gen AI Tools - never use Generative AI tools in writing journal manuscripts or conference papers.    
xxx Language and Grammar Assistance Tools - use OS native tools for spell checking, grammar, etc. Do not accept every writing style suggestion from online tools.
