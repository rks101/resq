[Scimago Journal Ranking](https://www.scimagojr.com/)   
Look for journals in the top quartile Q1 or Q2:   
Q1 (green) comprises the quarter of the journals with the highest values,   
Q2 (yellow) is the quarter with the second-highest-value journals,    
Q3 (orange) is the quarter with the third-highest-value journals, and    
Q4 (red) is the quarter with the lowest-value journals.    

e.g. [Computers and Security (CompSec)](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=28898&tip=sid&clean=0) is continuously green (Q1) in the past 10 years. So, is [IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials (COMSUR)](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17900156715&tip=sid&clean=0).

Note:-   
1. Open Access - is a model in which the authors pay article publishing charges (APC), and publication is open for all online. There are Gold/Silver/Bronze options for a wider reach of the audience having access to such publications. Many publications are turning into Open Access due to reduced memberships. You may avoid Open Access to save APC.    
2. Sponsored / Paid Access -  as the name suggests, its pay and publish model. Early researchers should avoid it.    
3. Special/companion edition - look for indexing and reputation.    

It is wise to stay away from country-specific predatory journals or controversial journals.
