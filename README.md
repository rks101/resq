## Journal Indexing   
Journal indexing can impact search/findings of your publications to others.   

[DBLP](https://dblp.org/) open indexing for CS publications   
[SCI]() - Science Citation Index   
[SCIe]() - Science Citation Index Expanded   
[Ei Compendex](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/engineering-village/content/compendex) from Elsevier    
[Scopus](https://scopusindexedjournals.com/)     
Google Scholar    
Web of Science   

[Scimago Journal Ranking](https://www.scimagojr.com/)   

Q1 (green) comprises the quarter of the journals with the highest values,   
Q2 (yellow) is the quarter with the second-highest-value journals,    
Q3 (orange) is the quarter with the third-highest-value journals, and    
Q4 (red) is the quarter with the lowest-value journals (may be avoided after inquiry).    

e.g.    
[ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR)](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23038&tip=sid&clean=0) is continuously green (Q1) during 2000-2022     
[Computers and Security (CompSec)](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=28898&tip=sid&clean=0) is continuously green (Q1) during 2011-2022.    
[IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials (COMSUR)](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17900156715&tip=sid&clean=0) is green (Q1) during 2006-2022.

Top CS Journals and Transactions may take up to 2 years from manuscript submission to acceptance notification and publishing. Hope this turn around time reduces to half.

## Conferences   

Top CS conferences can have paper acceptance rate well below 18%, or less than 1 in 6 papers submitted without desk-rejection.     

Reason for a desk-rejection can be:     
- length (too short or longer than mentioned in CFP)),    
- formatting of paper not as mentioned in CFP (single or 2-column, figures, tables, references, LNCS/IEEE/ACM style not adhered to),    
- no relevance to the venue or conference,     
- conference no longer accepting papers from a specific area,     
- plagiarism (more than 18-20% similarity detected),    
- too obvious Engligh/languase issues, etc. (Hope you noticed!)      


In Computer Science and related areas, conferences are rated higher and preffered because of rigourous peer reviews with quick feedback, usually notifying within 3-4 months.     

e.g.    
- CCS ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 
- ESORICS - European Symposium on Research in Computer Security  
- ICSE - [International Conference on Software Engineering](http://www.icse-conferences.org/)   
- ICIS - International Conference on Information Systems
- IFIP WG 11 - IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference on Data and Applications Security (was IFIP-DBSEC)
- S&P - 	IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy
- USENIX-Sec - Usenix Security
- ARES - International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security
- PETs - Privacy Enhancing Technologies (with PoPET)
- FSE - ACM Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering
- FST & TCS - Foundations of Software Technology & Theoretical Computer Science
- ICSP - International Conference on Software Process
- ISSTA - Internation Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis
- SPICE - Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination
- SSR - ACM Symposium on Software Reusability
- COMPSAC - International Computer Software and Applications Conference
- PASTE - ACM SIGSOFT Workshop on Program Analysis for Software Tools and Engineering
- STEP - Software Technology and Engineering Practice Conference

## Advice    

1. Target/publish in the journals or conferences in the top quartile Q1 or Q2: so that your work is reviewed by peers rigourously and reflects better credibility.    
2. Do not go after citation numbers (they can be synthetic) or numerical impact factor only (can be deceptive), to just publish your work.    
3. Inquire about the venue, quality of reviews, free/paid model, before you submit to publish your work. Be open to get rejections with good reviews from a good venue.    
4. Avoid Open-Access only or paid journals to publish your work.    
5. Regularly/Every year self-review at least 5-6 papers in your area to assess the work been done. Submit reviews without a reminder and within time! or do not accept to review. This helps the research community.    
6. Share papers with your scholars to assess how rigourously they review papers, it could be English/language aspects as well. Discuss and share what not to do and how not to publish, it is needed more than how to publish.    
7. Pay attention to references while you read/review papers, you might find pearls of wisdom :)     
8. Never submit a work without self-checking plagiarism. Target single digit similarity or less than 12% of similarity (for own contribution) or less than 18% of similarity (for Surveys/SoK). How disrespectful is to submit papers with verbatim copied/similar full-paragraph or full-sentences? They could be and should be desk-rejected.      
9. Never submit a work to publish by adding someone's name in the end or by referencing few highly-cited or synthetic citations-laid papers. This does not help the research community.     
10. Write papers on your own from scratch. Avoid generative AI tools for writing papers - they should be desk-rejected by publishers.     


Note:-   
1. Open Access - is a model in which the authors pay article publishing charges (APC), and publication is open for all online. There are Gold/Silver/Bronze options for the audience. Many publications are turning into Open Access model due to reduced memberships. You should avoid Open Access only model to save APC.    
2. Sponsored / Paid Access -  as the name suggests, its pay and publish model. Avoid it.    
3. Special/companion edition - look for indexing, availability and reputation.    

It is wise to stay away from country-specific predatory journals or controversial journals or the ones banned by any agency in the country.

## Publishers and Societies    

Elsevier    
Springer / Springer Nature    
IEEE     
ACM     
SIG - Special Interest Groups with ACM     
Nature    
Wiley    
SAGE    

Note: 
1. ScienceDirect is a platform/tool of Elsevier, a publishing company.    
2. arXiv is not a publisher, it is a great repository to claim or make your work available online without an accepted publication yet. Check with the publisher if they want you to remove the paper from arXiv due to embargo period.
3. Subscription-based versus Open Access (OA) model: One main difference is the publication dissemination cost. Under the subscription-based agreement the publishing company (Elsevier/ACM/IEEE) abosrbs the costs, and the end users/researchers have to pay through institutional contract or by self per paper. Under Open Access model, the author pays article publishing charges (APC) for the access to publication instead of the end users/researchers.
